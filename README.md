# About
This is a tool for performing various transpositions on Virtual Piano sheets.

You can:
- Transpose sheets by a set number
- Automatically find the easiest transposition to play (least sharps/flats/missing notes)
- Configure how out-of-bounds notes are handled (either with "?", transposing them to the nearest octave, or excluding them entirely)
- Compress a sheet to three octaves (intended for the control scheme of FFXIV bards)

> - This is NOT a MIDI conversion tool. I recommend looking elsewhere for that.
