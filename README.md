# About
This is a tool that can perform various tasks on Virtual Piano sheets.

You can:
- Transpose sheets by a set number
- Automatically find the easiest transposition to play (least sharps/flats/missing notes)
- Compress a sheet to three octaves (intended for the control scheme of FFXIV bards)
- Configure how out-of-bounds notes are handled (either with "?", transposing them to the nearest octave, or excluding them entirely)
    - The ability to notate octave-switching keys is planned.

> [!warning]
> - This is NOT a MIDI conversion tool. I recommend looking elsewhere for that.
